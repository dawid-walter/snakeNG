# SnakeNG - snake game in angular
My very first app was snake game in Java. I created this project to practice my Angular skills and for fun, my goal was port it from Java to TypeScript

## Features

- Single player snake game
- Keyboard control 

## Development server

Run `npm run start:dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. This generates a production build.
